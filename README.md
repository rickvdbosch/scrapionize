# Scrapionize

Scrapionize (Scraper Sessionize) is a NuGet package to scrape a Sessionize CFP page and give you the basic information
on there. The information we'll get from the CFP page:

* Name of the event
* Start and End Date of the event
* Location of the event
* URL of the event
* Start and End date of the CFP
* Arrangements around Travel, Accomodation and Event Fee for speakers
